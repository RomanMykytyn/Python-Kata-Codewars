Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string. If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1. If the string does not end with a number the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

Examples:

foo -> foo1

foobar23 -> foobar24

foo0042 -> foo0043

foo9 -> foo10

foo099 -> foo100

Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.

def increment_string(strng):
    if strng == "" or strng[-1].isdigit() == False:
        return strng + "1"
    count = ""
    for i in strng[::-1]:
        if i.isdigit() == True:
            count += i
        else:
            break
    count_2 = str( int(count[::-1]) + 1 )
    if len(count) >= len(str(count_2)):
        return strng[:-len(count_2)] + count_2
    else:
        return strng[:-len(count)] + count_2
